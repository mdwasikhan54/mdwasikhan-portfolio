# 💎 MD Wasi Khan - Portfolio Showcase

This repository contains the complete, production-ready source code for my professional portfolio. It serves as a single-page interactive demonstration of my development focus, combining a clean, modern UI with a strong emphasis on showcasing scalable backend architecture.

## ✨ Front-End Engineering & Design Architecture

The front-end is engineered for a premium, performant user experience without heavy frameworks.

* **Aesthetic:** **Glassmorphism 2.0:** A subtle, high-fidelity design language utilizing CSS `backdrop-filter` for a sleek, translucent container look that works flawlessly across both themes.
* **Theming:** **Dual-Mode System:** Custom-built system allowing users to instantly switch between the sophisticated **Dark Mode (Default)** and the bright, professional **Light Mode** using CSS Variables for minimal redraw.
* **Immersive UX:**
    * **Animated Particles:** A custom-coded Vanilla JS background particle system creates a subtle, dynamic atmosphere without taxing resources.
    * **Typing Animation:** Smooth, letter-by-letter introduction of the name with a permanent, blinking cursor for a polished Hero Section.
    * **Architecture:** Fully responsive, single-page application (SPA) style flow (`home.html`) for fast navigation across all core sections: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Blogs, and Contact.
* **Code Quality:** Clean, modular CSS (utilizing Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Variables) and lightweight Vanilla JavaScript ensures excellent load times and maintainability.

## 💻 Backend Skills Showcased

While the repository's code is focused on the front-end presentation, the content is specifically structured to highlight my expertise in:

* **API Development:** Featured projects focus on **FastAPI** for high-speed service development and **RESTful API** design.
* **Data Integrity:** Demonstrating security practices through **JWT Authentication** and data validation with **Pydantic**.
* **Ecosystem:** Showcasing proficiency in **PostgreSQL**, **Linux**, and modern Python dependency management with **Poetry**.
